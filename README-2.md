# 🚀 Student Group Project Management Portal

A Full-Stack MERN web application designed to simplify academic group project collaboration between teachers and students.

This platform replaces scattered communication (WhatsApp, emails, shared folders) with a structured environment where project progress, submissions, and responsibilities are clearly managed.

## 🎯 Problem

Managing college group projects is difficult because:

### 👨‍🏫 Teacher

* Create project groups
* Set deadlines
* Upload project requirements
* Monitor student submissions

### 🎓 Student

* Join groups
* View assigned projects
* Submit work
* Track project progress
